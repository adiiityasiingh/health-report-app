To test image OCR functionality:

1. Take a screenshot of the sample_health_report.txt file
2. Save it as a PNG or JPG file
3. Upload it to test the Google Vision API OCR

Or create a simple image with text like:
"HEALTH REPORT
Hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL 12.0-15.5
WBC 7800 cells/Î¼L 4,500-11,000"

This will test the image processing and OCR capabilities.
